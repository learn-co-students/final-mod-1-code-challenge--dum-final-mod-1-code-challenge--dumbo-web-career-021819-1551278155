# + `Viewer#queue_movies`
#   + this method should return an array of `Movie` instances in the `Viewer`'s queue.
# + `Viewer#add_movie_to_queue(movie)`
#   + this method should receive a `Movie` instance as its only argument and add it to the `Viewer`'s queue
# + `Viewer#rate_movie(movie, rating)`
#   + given a movie and a rating (a number between 1 and 5), this method should assign the rating to the viewer's `QueueItem` for that movie. If the movie is not already in the viewer's queue, this method should add a new `QueueItem` with the viewer, movie, and rating. If the movie is already in the queue, this method should not create a new `QueueItem`.
